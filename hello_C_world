Introduction to C programming

C is a general purpose programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. It is a successor to the B programming language. By design, it is compiled to provide low-level access to memory. 

Some important features of C

C is a procedural language

This means that programming in C follows a series of well-structured steps(procedures) within it's context. 

All C code has to be inside a function

C files have to be compiled with a compiler to create an exectable file ( I use the gcc compiler, all the demonstrated examples will be done in gcc)

Prerequisites

If you wish to follow along with the coding examples, I suggest that you install a compiler. Please refer to online resources on how to do that for your system.
